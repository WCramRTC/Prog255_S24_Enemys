The issue in your code likely stems from how you are calculating the new position and applying `Time.deltaTime`. The `Time.deltaTime` component is intended to adjust values to account for frame rate variations, ensuring smooth and consistent movement regardless of how fast the frames are being rendered. When you multiply a position vector directly by `Time.deltaTime`, it scales down the position values significantly, which might be causing your object not to visibly move towards the target.

Here's a correct approach to move an object towards another object in Unity, assuming you want to move the object at a consistent speed. You should use `Vector3.MoveTowards` or manually interpolate the position using linear interpolation (Lerp) and then scale the change in position by `Time.deltaTime` to ensure frame rate independence:

```csharp
// Speed at which the object moves
public float speed = 5.0f;

void Update() {
    // Current position
    Vector3 currentPosition = transform.position;

    // Target position
    Vector3 targetPosition = target.transform.position;

    // Ensuring the y-coordinate remains constant if needed
    targetPosition.y = currentPosition.y;

    // Calculate the new position moving towards the target
    Vector3 newPosition = Vector3.MoveTowards(currentPosition, targetPosition, speed * Time.deltaTime);

    // Update the object's position
    transform.position = newPosition;
}
```

In this corrected code:
1. **Speed**: Defined how fast the object moves towards the target.
2. **Vector3.MoveTowards**: Moves the point `currentPosition` towards `targetPosition` by the displacement `speed * Time.deltaTime` without exceeding it.

This way, your object will move smoothly towards the target at a constant speed, and the movement will be independent of the frame rate.
